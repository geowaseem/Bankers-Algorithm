# bankersalgorithm
A program that implements Banker's Algorithm to check safe status of a system


- The code defines the bankers_algorithm function, which takes the following inputs:

num_processes: The number of processes in the system.
num_resources: The number of resources in the system.
current_allocation: A matrix representing the current allocation of resources to processes.
max_matrix: A matrix representing the maximum resource requirements of processes.
available_resources: A list representing the available instances of each resource.

The function initializes several variables:

finish: An array indicating whether a process has finished or not. Initially, all processes are marked as unfinished.
safe_seq: An array to store the safe sequence of processes.
seq_index: A variable to keep track of the position in the safe_seq array.
need: A matrix representing the resource needs of processes. It is calculated as the difference between the maximum resource requirements and the current allocation.

- The function performs the Banker's algorithm to check if the system is in a safe state:

It iterates over the processes and checks if a process can be executed safely by comparing its resource needs with the available resources.
If a process can be executed safely, it is added to the safe sequence, and its allocated resources are released.
The process is marked as finished, and the available resources are updated.
This process continues until all processes have been checked.

- After the algorithm completes, the function checks if a safe sequence was found:

If a safe sequence exists, it generates a string representation of the safe sequence and displays it along with a message indicating that the system is in a safe state.
If no safe sequence is found, it displays a message indicating that the system is in an unsafe state.

- The run_code function is executed when the "Run" button is clicked:

It extracts the input values from the GUI fields.
It calls the bankers_algorithm function with the provided inputs.

- The main part of the code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library:

It creates a window and various GUI elements such as labels, entry fields, text boxes, and a "Run" button.
The user can enter the required inputs in the GUI fields.
Clicking the "Run" button triggers the execution of the run_code function.

* To test the code, you need to provide the necessary inputs through the GUI and click the "Run" button. The code will then apply the Banker's algorithm and display the results in the message box.
